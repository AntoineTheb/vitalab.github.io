**Welcome!**  on the literature review archive of the [Videos & Images Theory and Analytics Laboratory (VITAL) of Sherbrooke University](http://vital.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/), headed by Professor [Pierre-Marc Jodoin](http://info.usherbrooke.ca/pmjodoin).  Our lab focuses on image processing, computer vision, video analytics, medical imaging, and statistical modeling. If you are interested in collaborating with us, please do not hesitate to [contact us](http://vital.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/contact/)!

The goal of this website is to keep our members up to date with new advances in our ever changing research areas.  In that perspective, each time a member of the lab finds an interesting paper, he (or she) writes a short summary and uploads it on this repo.  Based on the tags the reviewer assigned to that paper, the other members of the lab associated with those tags will be notified and invited to comment.  In this way, a paper read and understood by a person gets shared with the rest of the people.  Furthermore, new members of the lab have an immediate access to a well structured literature review, which is great!
