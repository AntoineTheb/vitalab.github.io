Recently I stumbled on a couple of nice tutorial on active learning.  If the topic interests you, I suggest you go visit the following web pages:

1. [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/active-learning)
2. [Towarddatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/active-learning-tutorial-57c3398e34d)
2. [Hunch](http://hunch.net/~active_learning/active_learning_icml09.pdf)

Also, the following survey (although not new) provides a comprehensive overview of active learning methods.
