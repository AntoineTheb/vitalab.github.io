# Highlights

Authors propose to learn the track orientation mapping (TOM) and combine it with
the bundle outline and connected regions to perform bundle-specific
tractography.

The work builds up on a number of other works by the same group, including the
TractSeg method. An early version of it was reviewed [here](https://vitalab.github.io/article/2017/12/01/Stacked-UNets-Bundle-Segmentation.html).


# Introduction

A number of approaches have been proposed to filter the false positives that
current tractography techniques produce. These approaches can be grouped into
two categories:
- Clustering-based approaches: streamlines are filtered based on their spatial
relation to cortical or other anatomically defined regions.
- Region-of-interest-based approaches: group and select streamlines by measuring
intra- and inter-subject streamline similarities.

Authors propose to combine some of their earlier works, notably TOM and
TractSeg, and to add another bundle start and end filtering network to overcome
some of the limitations that these methods present individually.


# Methods

Authors use their TOM method to obtain the list of orientation maps (a local
mean streamline orientation of the track). TractSeg is used for white matter
bundle segmentation. Finally, another convolutional neural network is used to
segment the bundle start and end regions, which helps filtering tracks that end
prematurely or do not connect the regions corresponding to that bundle.

A probabilistic approach is used to obtain the tractography result using the
output of the three convolutional networks.

Authors propose to use the same 2D U-Net-based architecture for the three
networks. Random orientation sampling on the axial, coronal, and sagittal
directions is performed during training for bundle and region segmentation. At
inference time, the mean value of the predictions is used.

Losses:
- Cosine similarity + squared l2-norm for TOM.
- Binary cross-entropy for the segmentation networks.


The network input is composed of the fODFs peaks computed at each voxel. The
three principal fiber directions are kept for each voxel using the multi-tissue
multi-shell constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) method.

Authors used bundle-specific thresholds to improve results (especially on
bundles that are harder to track) to convert the computed probability maps to
binary maps.

Data augmentation was carried out applying:
- Affine transformation
- Elastic transformation
- Scaling
- Resampling
- Gaussian noise

## Data

Training was performed on the 105-subject, 72 bundle per subject HCP dataset.

Testing was performed on 17 datasets, including TRACED, Sherbrooke_3shell, HCP,
ADNI and OASIS. This means that the data used by the authors was acquired
with different scanners, different field strengths, different acquisition
protocols, different image qualities, and on brains with different diseases.

# Results

They used 3 widely used methods and 4 in-house methods (used earlier in their
TractSeg method) as their baselines:
- TractQuerier
- RecoBundles
- TRACULA
- Atlas registration
- Multiple mask registration
- Peak atlas
- Best original peak

Authors used 5-fold cross validation to select the parameters.

Metrics:
- **Segmentation performance**: Dice score.
- **Orientation performance**: voxel-wise angular error.

Their method is faster and produces more accurate bundle-specific tractograms.

# Conclusions

The presented method outperforms the baselines, providing more accurate bundle
segmentations and tractograms, and is less affected by the reduction in
resolution in the clinical quality data.

It also generalizes well to unseen datasets and pathologies.
