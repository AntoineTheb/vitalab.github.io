# Highlights

- Authors propose a methodology for training semantic segmentation networks on datasets with diverse supervision, including per-pixel, bounding box, and image-level labels.

- Authors introduce a new dataset *OpenScapes* dataset: a large, weakly labeled dataset with 200 000 images and 14 semantic classes for street scenes recognition.

# Introduction
They develop a hierarchical deep network architecture and the corresponding loss for semantic segmentation that can be trained from weak supervision, such as bounding boxes or image-level labels, as well as from strong per-pixel supervision.
Even from separate datasets, their model consistently increases the performance against per-pixel only training.

# Method
This method facilitates the training of any fully convolutional network for per-pixel semantic segmentation and only requires a specific structure of classifiers and a specialized loss to train them.

## Convolutional Network Architecture
The hierarchy of classifiers is constructed according to the availability of strong and weak labels for each class.
The root classifier contains high-level classes with per-pixel labels.
Each one of the subclassifiers corresponds to one high-level class of the root classifier and contains subclasses with per-pixel and/or weak supervision.
The shared feature representation is pass through two shallow, per-classifier adaptation networks, which adapt the common representation, its depth, and receptive field to meet the requirements of each classifier.

## Generation of pseudo per-pixel ground truth from weak labels
The goal is to train the network with per-pixel labels, thus need to generate per-pixel ground truth from bounding boxes and image-level labels.
That method is valid only for square-shaped, compact objects, like traffic signs, and cannot be applied to image-level labels.

This approach model per-pixel labels as a dense or multi-hot categorical probability distribution, and thus the ground truth for each image becomes 3D.
This model assigns to each pixel a probability for every class, and the sum of probabilities for all classes must be 1.
They normalize across all classes, in order for the labels to represent a valid probability distribution.

## Hierarchical loss
To help the network, they construct the hierarchical loss, namely the loss is accumulated unconditionally for per-pixel labeled datasets and conditionally for per bounding box or per image-level labeled datasets.

For each classifier, a general form of a categorical cross-entropy loss is used.
For the root classifier, they use a sparse version of the categorical cross-entropy loss.
