# Highlights

- Deep learning tractography method
- Predicts the parameters for a unimodal distribution on the sphere (Fisher von Mises)
- Uncertainty quantification
- Maximum-entropy regularization as loss function instead of NLL to enforce non-zero uncertainty and robustness to noise

# Method

**Model**: Simple Multi-Layer perceptron

**Input**: 
- Block of 3x3x3 voxels of DWI data fitted with spherical harmonics of order 4 (15 values per voxel = 405 features)
- 4 last directions (3 values per direction = 12 features)


**Prediction**: Parameters of a Fisher von Mises distribution:

The Fisher von Mises distribution is analogous to a Gaussian on the Sphere. It has a mean parameter $$\mu$$ and a *concentration* parameter $$\kappa$$.

**Loss function**: Total free energy given the predicted distribution parameters (and a temperature hyper-parameter $$T$$), which can be calculated analytically for the Fisher von Mises distribution


The model is optimized using SGD and gradient clipping.

# Experiments

- Training: 1 HCP subject, tracked using a probabilistic algorithm.

- Testing: Tractometer tool (synthetic signal, 25 GT bundles to reconstruct)
    - Output metrics: Valid Bundles (VB), Invalid Bundles (IB), Valid Connections (VC), Overlap (OL), Overreach (OR), F1-score (using overlap + overreach)

## Results

> The Entrack model achieves scores comparable to the other works, indicating its usefulness as predictive model for fiber tracking, in addition to its benefits of uncertainty quantification, and outlier detection.


- See figure 6: The model is also trained on the tractometer data and used to color the training streamlines according to the total probability ((a) and (b) or local uncertainty ((c) and (d)).
